    "- A **3-layer network** (excluding input layer) is used.  \n",
    "- **ReLU activation** is applied in hidden layers.  \n",
    "- **No activation function** in the output layer since regression doesn't require output constraints like classification.  \n",

    "## **Training the Model**\n",
    "1. **Forward pass**: Inputs propagate through the network, producing a predicted price.  \n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation**: Difference between **predicted output (\\(\\hat{y}\\))** and **actual price (\\(y\\))** is computed.  \n",
    "3. **Backpropagation**: Gradient descent is used to adjust **weights** and **biases** iteratively.  \n",
    "4. **Convergence**: The process repeats until the loss is minimized.  \n",
