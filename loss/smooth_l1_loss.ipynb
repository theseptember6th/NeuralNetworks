    "Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the key points from the lecture on **Smooth L1 Loss and Huber Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction to Smooth L1 Loss & Huber Loss**\n",
    "- These loss functions are preferred over standard **L1 Loss** (MAE) and **L2 Loss** (MSE) because they combine their advantages.\n",
    "- **Smooth L1 Loss** behaves like **L2 loss** (quadratic) when the error is small and like **L1 loss** (linear) when the error is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Smooth L1 Loss Formula & Explanation**\n",
    "- The formula consists of two parts:\n",
    "  - If the absolute error is **less than 1**, the function follows an **L2 loss** pattern.\n",
    "  - If the absolute error is **greater than 1**, it follows an **L1 loss** pattern.\n",
    "- This helps:\n",
    "  - Reduce the sensitivity to outliers (unlike MSE, which amplifies large errors).\n",
    "  - Prevent **exploding gradients**, which can destabilize training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Parameterizing the Threshold (Î²)**\n",
    "- Instead of fixing the threshold at **1**, we introduce a parameter **Î²**.\n",
    "- This allows flexibilityâ€”**Î²** can be adjusted based on the dataset.\n",
    "- A **dynamic approach** can be used, where **Î²** is updated over time to improve training efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Huber Loss & Comparison with Smooth L1 Loss**\n",
    "- In **TensorFlow**, Smooth L1 Loss is referred to as **Huber Loss**.\n",
    "- In **PyTorch**, both **Smooth L1 Loss** and **Huber Loss** exist as separate functions.\n",
    "- **Key difference**: Huber Loss is simply **Î² times the Smooth L1 Loss**, meaning it **scales** the loss values.\n",
    "- Increasing **Î² (or Delta)** makes the loss function behave more like an L2 loss over a wider range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Practical Use**\n",
    "- Both loss functions are widely used in **regression tasks** because they:\n",
    "  - Handle outliers better than MSE.\n",
    "  - Prevent exploding gradients.\n",
    "  - Adapt dynamically to different error ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Implementation**\n",
    "- The functions are straightforward to implement:\n",
    "  - Compute the difference between prediction and ground truth.\n",
    "  - Apply the quadratic term when the error is small and the linear term when the error is large.\n",
    "\n",
